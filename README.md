# Rock Paper Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game! This project is a simple implementation of the classic game using Python and Tkinter.

## How to Play

To start the game, click the "Start Game" button. You'll then be presented with the game interface, where you can select Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer will also make a random choice, and the winner will be announced.

## Code Explanation

The code is organized into different sections:

- **Import Libraries**: We import the necessary libraries, including Tkinter for the GUI, Pillow (PIL) for working with images, and random for generating computer choices.

- **Create the Main Window**: We create the main window for the game with a title and background color.

- **Welcome Message**: Initially, a welcome message is displayed along with a "Start Game" button. When the button is clicked, the game starts, and the welcome message and button are hidden.

- **Functions**: We define several functions to handle different aspects of the game, including updating scores, checking the winner, and updating choices.

- **Styled Buttons**: We create styled buttons for user choices (Rock, Paper, Scissors).

- **Grid Layout**: The buttons are arranged in a grid layout for a neat appearance.

## How to Run

To run the game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your computer using Git.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
